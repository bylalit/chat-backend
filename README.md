This is a real-time chat application where users can easily register, log in, and chat with each other instantly. The application is built using Angular for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The main focus of this project is to provide fast and smooth real-time communication with a simple and clean user interface.

For real-time messaging, Socket.IO is used, which allows messages to appear instantly without refreshing the page. The application also includes a secure authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token), so only logged-in users can access the chat features.

All user details and chat messages are stored in MongoDB, which helps in managing and saving data properly. On the frontend side, the app is developed using Angular standalone components, along with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, to make the UI responsive and user-friendly on different devices.

The backend is built using Express.js, which provides REST APIs for user authentication and handles real-time communication with Socket.IO. The frontend of this project is deployed on Vercel, and the backend is deployed on Render, making the application available online.

This project is very helpful for understanding full-stack development, real-time chat using WebSockets, user authentication, and how frontend and backend work together in a real-world application.
